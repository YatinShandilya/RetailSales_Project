 -- Q.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';


-- Q.2 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
  AND quantiy >= 4
  AND sale_date LIKE '2022-11%'
ORDER BY sale_date, sale_time;


-- Q.3 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category

-- Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'


-- Q.5 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000


-- Q.6 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.

SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP 
    BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1


-- Q.7 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year

WITH monthly AS (
    SELECT 
        YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
        MONTH(sale_date)  AS month,
        AVG(total_sale)   AS avg_sale
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
)
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    ROUND(avg_sale, 2) AS avg_sale
FROM monthly m1
WHERE avg_sale = (
    SELECT MAX(avg_sale)
    FROM monthly m2
    WHERE m2.year = m1.year
)
ORDER BY year, month;
    
-- ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC

-- Q.8 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales 

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5

-- Q.9 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.


SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category


-- Q.10 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)

WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
